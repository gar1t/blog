In a previous post, I described my [note-taking workflow with
zettelkasten and org]({{< relref "zettelkasten_with_org" >}}). I extracted some of that logic out into a Github
repository, and it sort of took a life of its own. Now that it's
gaining a bit of popularity and usage, I thought I'd do a more formal
introduction to the package, and how I use it. It is not published on
MELPA, and likely won't be for a while, but you can find it on Github
[here](https://github.com/jethrokuan/org-roam). The features I really need are in, so once bug reports stop
coming, I'll cut a release, and start taking its development more
formally.


## What is Org-roam? {#what-is-org-roam}

Org-roam is an attempt at replicating Roam in Emacs, built upon the
all-powerful Org-mode format. Like Roam, it is a note-taking tool for
networked thought. The tool encourages a non-hierarchical note-taking
workflow. With Org-roam, note-taking becomes effortless and fun: write
notes wherever you want, and link them up however you want. For more
information about why a tool like this would be useful, you can read
the following articles:

## Why Org-roam? {#why-org-roam}

Org-roam may seem like a result of NIH syndrome, and perhaps there's
some partial truth to that. After all, it started out as [27 lines of
code on top of deft](https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/ebrw2l/has%5Fanybody%5Fhere%5Ftried%5Fthe%5Froam%5Fresearch/fd8cp4c?utm%5Fsource=share&utm%5Fmedium=web2x). However, I believe there is some merit in
building a tool for Emacs.

1.  Never having to leave Emacs. That's an additional context switch
    I can avoid.
2.  Leverage all the powerful features of Org-mode: LaTeX, tables, and
    the whole to-do ecosystem. Ties in well with my [org-mode workflow]({{< relref "org_mode_workflow_preview" >}}).
3.  Be in full control your second brain, and access it offline.

There are already several packages in Emacs that have some overlapping
functionality, including [org-brain](https://github.com/Kungsgeten/org-brain), [zetteldeft](https://github.com/EFLS/zetteldeft), and [org-zettelkasten](https://github.com/l3kn/org-zettelkasten).
Here's what makes org-roam different:

First, in org-roam, the ordinary org file-link syntax is used.
Contrast this with org-brain which uses org heading IDs, and
zetteldeft that uses a special indicator. Org-roam is a plug-and-play
solution that should work with existing Org files. This means org-roam
can remain small, and its behaviour is predictable (it's just 300 LOC
now).

Second, org-roam mimics more closely Roam's interface of an always-
updating sidebar that shows backlinks and their preview content. This
is as far as I know unique to org-roam at the time of writing.


## Shut Up and  Show Me the Goods {#shut-up-and-show-me-the-goods}

Alright, alright.

I'm going to be slightly unconventional here, and first show you the
graph of my notes.  Of course, this graph is generated by org-roam.
Feel free to view the image in another window, to bask at it in its
full glory. This is a testament to how non-hierarchical note-taking
can be, and should be.

{{< figure src="/ox-hugo/graph.svg" caption="Figure 1: org-roam graph" >}}

All of this starts from the note. A note is just a simple `.org` file
in the directory. Any org file in the directory is considered part of
the org-roam ecosystem. Notes are quickly linked together (and created
if necessary) using `org-roam-insert`. Yes I know the GIFs look
crappy here. Do me a favour and right click -> view image would you.

{{< figure src="/ox-hugo/org-roam-insert.gif" caption="Figure 2: org-roam-insert makes it easy to add links" >}}

Org-roam tracks all of these file links, and builds a cache
asynchronously in the background. This cache is used to populate the
backlinks buffer, which shows files that link to the current file, as
well as some preview contents:

{{< figure src="/ox-hugo/org-roam-buffer.gif" caption="Figure 3: the org-roam buffer gives a nice navigable preview of backlinked content" >}}

If that's not enough, the org-roam graph shows is navigable. This is
especially nice when using exwm, but that's not necessary.

## What's next? {#what-s-next}

I'd always been building out Org-roam as my workflow adapts. Now that
there's a small community using it, I foresee that changing a little.
I'd think org-roam will still be highly guided by my tastes, but I
don't imagine forking off org-roam to be challenging, since the code
is relatively simple.

A lot of the core functionality is already there, but some things
could definitely be improved, including:

1.  The aesthetics of the org-buffer.
2.  Smaller graph generations around the current content.

Once the core features are stable, I'd like to start working on
introducing features that the Emacs ecosystem makes possible:

-   Keyboard-friendly navigation ‚≠ê: perhaps using [link-hint](https://github.com/noctuid/link-hint.el) or the like.
-   Rendering small SVGs within Emacs.


## Give it a shot! {#give-it-a-shot}

Give it a try, and [let me know what you think](mailto:jethrokuan95@gmail.com).  What else would you
like to see?
