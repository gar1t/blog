#+TITLE: Experimenting with Remembrance Agents
#+DATE: <2020-01-06 Mon>

Recently someone brought the concept of [[http://alumni.media.mit.edu/~rhodes/Papers/remembrance.html][Remembrance Agents]] to my
attention. Remembrance Agents are programs which augment the human
memory by displaying documents, such as notes and emails, that are
potentially relevant to the current context. This fascinated me, and I
thought I could potentially incorporate something similar into my
[[https://braindump.jethro.dev/][braindump]] [[file:zettelkasten_with_org.org][workflow]], so I set aside some hours to see how I could get a
proof-of-concept out.

* Existing Software

A simple Github search reveals that any relevant software is dated and
unmaintained. NLP has come really far in the past decade, and new
techniques should definitely contribute to higher quality
recommendations.

Several other techniques seemed plausible off the top of my mind.
Topic models such as [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latent_Dirichlet_allocation][Latent Dirichlet Allocation]] (on which [[https://github.com/jethrokuan/lda-survey][I spent a
year researching on]]) could compute topics and their topical
similarities. It even has an online learning algorithm, which makes it
an attractive solution with an ever-growing knowledge dump. I wasn't
sure how to handle documents that are constantly changing (edited), so
I just left that as a thought.

[[https://www.lesbonscomptes.com/recoll/][Recoll]] is a mature indexing and search tool that does a fantastic job
of retrieval, but is based on keyword search. It would not be able to
detect documents that are similar, despite using different words.
However, it had a feature which indexes every web-page I visit, and
it was interesting enough for me to try out, so I went with Recoll.

* Setting Up Recoll

After installing Recoll, I installed [[https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/recoll-we/][the firefox extension]], which
queues every page I visit for processing. I then setup Recoll to run
as a daemon on startup, with the following config:

#+begin_src text
  topdirs =  ~/.org/braindump/org/ ~/Downloads
  monitordirs = ~/.org/braindump/org/ ~/Downloads
  processwebqueue = true
#+end_src

* Writing Org-Remembrance

Similar to the original Remembrance Agents design, I wanted
~org-remembrance~ to be unintrusive. Hence I've decided that it would:

1. Run only when idle for some time. Here I chose 2 seconds.
2. Choose automatically what to query. I arbitrarily decided to use a
   window of words around the current word-at-point as the query.

I went though [[https://github.com/stardiviner/org-recoll][org-recoll]]'s code and [[https://www.lesbonscomptes.com/recoll/usermanual/usermanual.html][Recoll's documentation]] to see what
I could adapt. Org-recoll did not provide some results that I wanted,
such as the relevancy rating, so I rewrote some of the parsing logic.

After about 3 hours, I had something decent working, and the code can
be found [[https://github.com/jethrokuan/org-remembrance][here]].

* Demo

Here it is updating the queries after I'm idle for 2 seconds, using
the words around it.

One can also query a region manually, by marking a region:

* Was it useful?

I tried this out for a while, and have concluded that the results that
I got back weren't useful enough to warrant my attention, for several
reasons:

1. The queries contain stop-words, which reduces the relevancy of the
   search
2. It's difficult to guess the user's intent
3. I was not indexing enough documents (only my notes), so there
   was little relevant information to resurface anyway

Manual searches produced better results, and sometimes surfaced
relevant web pages that I've visited, but that is not the selling
point of Remembrance Agents.

* Extensions

Perhaps this would be more useful if I could augment local results
with search results found on the web, similar to how Google's search
engine guesses a user intent, showing cards like:

1. Word definitions
2. Answers on Stack Overflow
3. Summaries on Wikipedia

I'd think using topic models would take this a notch further. Using
entire paragraphs as the query should give more robust results.

Let me know if you find good software that implements the ideas of
Remembrance Agents well! This has certainly been an interesting
exercise, and I'd say for just 3 hours of hacking, well worth-it.
