#+TITLE: Real World OCaml: A Review

Real World OCaml is peppered with interesting tidbits about the
implementations of OCaml that help with understanding the way the
language is constructed.

Here's a quote about the limitations of pattern matching, which
helped my understand the deliberation behind its constraints.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
You can think of patterns as a specialized sublanguage that can
express a limited (though still quite rich) set of conditions. The
fact that the pattern language is limited turns out to be a good
thing, making it possible to build better support for patterns in the
compiler. In particular, both the efficiency of match statements and
the ability of the compiler to detect errors in matches depend on the
constrained nature of patterns.
