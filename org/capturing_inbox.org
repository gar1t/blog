#+TITLE: Org-mode Workflow Part 1: Capturing in the Inbox

Have you ever sat yourself down with a piece of paper, writing out a
list of things to do? I want you to remember how you felt right after.
Did you feel a little bit more in control? Isn't it strange that you
feel better looking at the long list of work to do, knowing that your
little exercise accomplished nothing on the list? What was the point
of the exercise in the first place?

The list made you feel more in control because it freed yourself from
having to remember to do these things. With every task on paper, you
can utilize the full capacity of your brain to do the actual hard work
of accomplishing tasks.

Your brain is for having ideas, not storing them -- David Allen

The inbox is where everything begins. Every article, every thought,
every assignment first ends up in the inbox. Because the inbox is so
key to the process, it is important that it is easy to add items into
the inbox, and equally easy to process them. The inbox is all about
trust. Trust that you everything you will need to think about is
captured somewhere. This allows you to give your 100% for the current
task.

Tasks pile up quickly, and arrive whenever they please, more often
than not while we are in the middle of something. It is important that
we are able to file these tasks away quickly, and keep our attention
on the current task.

*** Capturing Items Manually

Org-mode ships with a feature called [[https://orgmode.org/manual/Capture.html][org-capture]], which allows for
quick storage of notes, anywhere. I use this to quickly add anything
to my inbox.

*** Capturing Articles

Org-mode has a neat feature called [[https://orgmode.org/worg/org-contrib/org-protocol.html][org-protocol]], one of which ties in
neatly with org-capture. Here, I use a Javascript bookmarklet to
automatically add web-pages, PDFs to my inbox.

*** Capturing Email

I use an email system called [[https://notmuchmail.org/][notmuch]]. I have 3 important email
accounts to keep up with, so I use [[http://isync.sourceforge.net/][isync]] to periodically fetch my
email and save them for offline use, and the Emacs notmuch interface
gives me access to mail from all accounts at the same time:

Capturing an email is also a key away. It creates an entry in my inbox
with a link to the email.

*** What's Next? 

I've shown that org-mode provides great tooling to capture items. With
this, we have completed probably the most impactful step in the
workflow. In the next part of the series, I will explain how I process
these items.
